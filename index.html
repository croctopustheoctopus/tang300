<h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p> The Tang Dynasty (唐朝) ruled China from 618 to 907 (with a brief hiatus from 690 to 705 for the Wu Zhou (武周)). During the Qing Dynasty (大清) nearly a thousand years — sometime around 1763 — Sun Zhu (孙洙) compiled over 300 poems from the Tang Dynasty into a poetry anthology aptly titled 《唐诗三百首》 AKA “Three Hundred Tang Poems.” Sun actually selected closer to 320 poems for his anthology, all based on their popularity and educational value. </p>
 <p> These poems have since been translated many times, with the newest edition published in 2009. Some of these translations take creative leaps in their translations, introducing concepts that were never mentioned in the original text. This website aims to translate “Three Hundred Tang Poems” with a focus on the literal imagery depicted on the page, allowing the reader to draw their own interpretations from the text.  </p>
<h2>Sorting Poems</h2>
	<p> There are three broad categories that these poems can be sorted into: yuefu (乐府), gushi (古诗), and regulated verse/jintishi (近体诗). There are subdivisions in these categories that depend on the number of characters in the lines (usually five or seven).
<ol>
<li>Yuefu (乐府), or "folk song-styled verse," are poems derived from the folk ballad tradition.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> In other words, these poems are often inspired/written as song lyrics. The most common form to find Yuefu is in five-character lines, though lines can also be of uneven lengths. (000, 000, 000)</li>
<li>Gushi (古诗), which literally translates as "old poetry," is characterized by pairs of rhyming couplets. Gushi can be divided into five-character ancient verse and seven-character ancient verse. (000, 000, 000) </li>
	<ul>
	<li>Five-character ancient verse has five characters in each line. (000, 000, 000) - EXAMPLES </li>
	<li>Seven-character ancient verse has (you guessed it) seven characters in each line. (000, 000, 000) - EXAMPLES </li>
	</ul>
<li>The last category, regulated verse, is thought to have been invented — or at least popularized — in the Tang Dynasty. Regulated verse can be further divided into lüshi (律诗), eight-line regulated verse, and jueju (绝句), the Chinese quatrain. Regulated verse must follow the following rules:</li>
	<ul>
	<li>Lüshi (律诗) poems are all rhymed on even lines, with a single lime used throughout the poem. Each poem has eight lines, but the number of characters in each line can vary:</li>
		<ul>
		<li>Wulü (五律) has eight lines of five characters. (000, 000, 000)</li>
		<li>Qilü (七律) has eight lines of seven characters. (000, 000, 000)</li>
		</ul>
	<li>Jueju (绝句) poems are always quatrains, usually two couplets. Each line has either five (五絕) or seven (七絕) characters.</li>
	</ul>
</ol>
<h3>Rules for Regulated Verse/近体诗</h3>
	<p>Many of the rules outlined here also apply to Gushi (古诗).</p>
<ul>
  <li>Line limits: jueju (绝句) is limited to four lines; lüshi (律诗) is limited to eight. Lines are arranged in couplet pairs.</li>
  <li>Line lengths must remain consistent character length throughout the poem. In other words: if your first line is five characters long, the rest of your lines must be five characters long.</li>
  <li>Mandatory rhyme. Tone patterns are decided by alternating patterns of level (tone1) and deflected tones (tones2-4). </li>
<li>Parallelism: parallel lines must match word-to-word in terms of grammatical function (ie. colors, actions, numbers, etc.), comparison/contrast, sound, and more. Lüshi is more strict than jueju when it comes to parallelism.</li>
	<li>Caesura: a major caesura must preceed the last three syllables in a line. For seven-character lines, there's generally a minor caesura between the first and second pairs of charcters.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup></li>
</ul>
