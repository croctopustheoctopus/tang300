<h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p> The Tang Dynasty (唐朝) ruled China from 618 to 907 (with a brief hiatus from 690 to 705 for the Wu Zhou (武周)). During the Qing Dynasty (大清) nearly a thousand years — sometime around 1763 — Sun Zhu (孙洙) compiled over 300 poems from the Tang Dynasty into a poetry anthology aptly titled 《唐诗三百首》 AKA “Three Hundred Tang Poems.” Sun actually selected closer to 320 poems for his anthology, all based on their popularity and educational value. </p>
 <p> These poems have since been translated many times, with the newest edition published in 2009. Some of these translations take creative leaps in their translations, introducing concepts that were never mentioned in the original text. This website aims to translate “Three Hundred Tang Poems” with a focus on the literal imagery depicted on the page, allowing the reader to draw their own interpretations from the text.  </p>
