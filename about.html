	<h2> Who's Translating?</h2>
  <p> This website is a passion project spearheaded by Daisy Newbury. Daisy has been studying Mandarin for nearly six years, since her freshman year of high school. After translating one of the Three Hundred Tang Poems (028) for a class assignment, she discovered that many of the translations online for these poems take liberties that stray from the literal text on the page. Now, she is slowly working her way through the anthology in her free time, translating these poems the best she can.
  </p>
<p> If you have any questions or comments about any of these translations, please find Daisy on her LinkedIn below. </p>
	<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>Though I have studied Chinese for over half a decade, I am by no means fluent. I am an amateur translator fueled 99% by my passion for the language and 1% by my dissatisfaction with current translations. I also lack a formal background in Chinese history. If there are historical connotations I am missing out on, please reach out! I cannot express how excited I am to talk with people about this project. </p>
<p>With <3, Daisy (钮文美）</p>
