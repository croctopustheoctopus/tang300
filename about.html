  <p> This website is a passion project spearheaded by Daisy Newbury. Daisy has been studying Mandarin for nearly six years, since her freshman year of high school. After translating one of the Three Hundred Tang Poems (028) for a class assignment, she discovered that many of the translations online for these poems take liberties that stray from the literal text on the page. Now, she is slowly working her way through the anthology in her free time, translating these poems the best she can.

  <p> If you have any questions or comments about any of these translations, please reach out to Daisy through LinkedIn! </p>
